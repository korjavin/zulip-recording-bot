# Project Instructions for AI Agents

This file provides instructions and context for AI coding agents working on this project.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/core-concepts/sync-concepts.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

## Build & Test

```bash
gofmt -l . && go vet ./... && go test -race ./...
docker build -t zulip-recording-bot .
```

Unit tests must pass offline: no network, no Zulip, no recorder, no
transcriber. Use `net/http/httptest` for every HTTP boundary (Zulip API, fake
recorders, fake transcriber).

## Architecture Overview

A Zulip bot that records calls on request. It notices call links in Zulip
(🎙️ reaction offer in streams, direct requests by DM), asks the matching
recorder service (`jitsi-recorder`, `meet-recorder`) to record over HTTP,
receives their signed events, keeps the user informed, hands finished
recordings to the transcriber and posts "transcript ready" when tr2outline
calls `POST /notify`.

**`docs/architecture.md` is the spec and the canonical copy** of the recorder
contract shared with `korjavin/jitsi-recorder` and `korjavin/meet-recorder`.
A contract change lands here first and is then copied to both recorders.

The bot never touches audio: it does not mount the recordings volume and has
no browser, Node or PulseAudio in its image.

- Go `package main` at the repo root, flat files, **stdlib only** — no
  dependencies (no go.sum).
- Configuration is env-only; `config.go` is the single reader of `os.Getenv`.

## Conventions & Patterns

- **English only** in every public artifact: README, docs, code comments,
  commit messages, PR bodies, `.env.example`.
- **Public repo:** never commit real domains, emails, keys, stream/topic names
  or user data. Use placeholders (`example.com`, `SomeRoom`).
- Never log secrets — log the variable NAME. Never log a full meeting URL (it
  may carry a token); log the room name / meeting code.
- Docs describe this service as designed from scratch: never reference the
  repositories or code it was derived from. Bead descriptions may name a source
  to copy from; the README and docs must not.
